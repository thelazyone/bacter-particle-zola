# An evolution simulator (written in Rust) mod for particle-zola

Particle-zola is a port for Zola of the Particle Jekyll theme. Check out the repo at https://github.com/svavs/particle-zola.

The only change in the theme consists in a different background logic.

Each ball has a size and an aggression level, and when/if manages to eat enough algae or other bacters it reproduces, creating
offsprings with slight changes in parameters.

And voil√†, we have evolution! Check out the [Bacter](https://github.com/thelazyone/Bacter/) repo for more info.

The code for Bacter is entirely written in Rust and compiled with wasm-pack. I tried to add as little JS as possible to make it work on Zola.

This is a simple and minimalist template for Zola designed for developers that want to show of their portfolio.

## Installation and Usage

Refer to [particle-zola](https://github.com/svavs/particle-zola) for anything not strictly related to Bacter.
[Bacter](https://github.com/thelazyone/Bacter/) itself is going to be provided as binary for the time being. 
In the future it will instead part of the theme building process.

## Issues

For any problem or suggestion regarding Bacter, please file a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/thelazyone/Bacter/issues/new) on the Bacter repo.
